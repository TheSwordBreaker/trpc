Although tRPC v11 has been stable for a long time via the `@next` tag, we've been kinda addicted to adding new features and goodies over the last 12 months in preparation for a big release. Today, we're excited to announce the official release of tRPC v11. This release is the result of months of hard work by [Katt](https://twitter.com/alexdotjs), the core team, and the community. We're excited to share the new features and improvements with you.

Since our last major version release in November 2022, the tRPC community has seen substantial growth:

- We now have nearly [35,000 stars on GitHub](https://github.com/trpc/trpc)
- [A Discord community](https://trpc.io/discord) with over 5,000 members
- [650k+ weekly npm downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trpc/server)
- [100s of contributors](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/graphs/contributors)
- [An _awesome_ ecosystem of extensions, examples, and content](https://trpc.io/awesome)

**With the launch of tRPC v11**, we're excited to share that v11 is already being used in production by many large TypeScript projects thanks to its stable evolution on `@next`. This official release though marks the end of an exciting development cycle which brings support for react-query v5, nextjs app router, and a lot of other goodies.

For new projects, you can get up and running with an [example application](https://trpc.io/awesome#-starting-points-example-projects-etc) to learn about tRPC v11. For projects still on tRPC v10, [visit the v11 migration guide](https://trpc.io/docs/v11/migrate-from-v10-to-v11).

## Overview of changes

v11 is a largely backward-compatible release with v10, but it brings a lot of new features and improvements. Here are some of the highlights:

### React Query v5 support

When [Tanstack Query v5](https://tanstack.com/blog/announcing-tanstack-query-v5) was released it necessitated some breaking changes within tRPC's react-query integration. This has been available since quite early on in the `@next` tag, but now it's officially release. Many projects have already chosen to upgrade over recent months and been enjoying the benefits of full React Suspense support and [many other improvements](https://tanstack.com/blog/announcing-tanstack-query-v5).

### Goodbye v9 `.interop()`-mode

In tRPC v10, we introduced the `.interop()`-mode to provide a smooth migration path for tRPC v9 users. With tRPC v11, we've removed the `.interop()`-mode. If you're still using the `.interop()`-mode, you can use the [v10 migration guide](https://trpc.io/docs/v10/migrate-from-v9-to-v10) to complete your transition to the APIs used by tRPC today.

### Next.js app router

### SSE Based Subscriptions

tRPC v11 introduces a new way to handle subscriptions using [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](/docs/server/subscriptions#websockets-or-server-sent-events). This is a great way to handle real-time updates in your application without the need for more complex WebSockets. The feature is still young and evolving so we're looking for further feedback from the community as it evolves.

## Migrating to v11

If you're currently using tRPC v10, you can follow the [migration guide](https://trpc.io/docs/v11/migrate-from-v10-to-v11) to upgrade to v11. The migration guide covers all the breaking changes and new features in v11.

## Thank you!

The core team and I want you to know: we're just getting started. We're already busy experimenting with [React Server Components](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/229) and Next.js 13.

I also want to give a huuuge shoutout to [Sachin](https://twitter.com/s4chinraja), [Julius](https://twitter.com/jullerino), [James](https://twitter.com/jlalmes), [Ahmed](https://twitter.com/ixahmedxii), [Chris](https://twitter.com/trashh_dev), [Theo](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg), [Anthony](https://twitter.com/shewDev), and [all the contributors who helped make this release possible](https://github.com/trpc/trpc#all-contributors).

Thanks for using and supporting tRPC.
